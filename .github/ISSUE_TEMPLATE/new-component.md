### Screen Shot

Provide a screenshot to quickly evaluate the component. Eg:

> ![My Button]()


### InVision Preview Link

Provide a preview link to the component inside InVision here. This will allow designers to give more detailed feedback. Eg:

> [Invision Preview](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/default/#/console/15908630/330057874/preview)


### Use Cases

Provide examples of how the component will be used, visuals welcome! Eg:

> Select fields are common form components used to select categorical data. It should remain similar in design to a text box so as to suggest input from the user when placed inline with other form components.


### Variations

Describe variations of the component and their uses here. Eg:

> #### Disabled - Select fields may be disabled or locked, preventing input
>
> ![disabled selection](/disabled.png)


### Existing Implementations

If there are other existing implementations for this pattern already, list them here and explain how they should be consolidated. Eg:

> #### Website Contact Form
>
> ![Contact](/contact.png)
>
> The contact form select fields are the primary inspiration for this design and should be able to be replaced with the design system's implementation seamlessly.
